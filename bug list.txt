start/stop/start/stop crashes (not a timing issue)
filezilla when accessing shared folder only shows first word in folder title if spaces in title
when downloading, asked to overwrite after timeout (likely related to no download complete signal being sent)
folder not saved between sessions --> will be fixed automatically with proper login database
